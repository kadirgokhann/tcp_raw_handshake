Network Communication Framework
This repository implements a basic TCP/IP communication framework using C++. The code provides both client and server functionalities for managing TCP sessions, handling packet transmission, and supporting asynchronous communication.

Features
TCP Client and Server: Implements TCP connections using custom session management for both client and server environments.
Packet Handling: Provides utilities to define and manage network packets, allowing for structured data transmission.
Asynchronous Processing: Supports asynchronous handling of TCP sessions to ensure non-blocking communication.
Session Management: Separate classes to manage client and server TCP sessions, ensuring clean and modular handling of communication channels.
Error Handling: Integrated mechanisms for error detection and recovery during TCP communication.
Modular Design: Clear separation between different components like session management, packet handling, and client-server logic for easier maintainability.
Code Structure
Session Management: Classes dedicated to managing client and server TCP sessions, ensuring proper initiation, data handling, and session termination.
Packet Handling: Encapsulates packet structures and methods for creating, sending, and receiving packets over a TCP connection.
Client-Server Interaction: Implements logic for establishing connections, sending/receiving data, and managing multiple sessions efficiently.
Utilities: Helper functions to streamline common operations related to networking and session control.
Dependencies
C++17 or later
Boost.Asio (for asynchronous networking)
Getting Started
Building the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
cd repositoryname
Ensure that Boost is installed on your system.

Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang):

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++17 -o server Server.cpp TcpSession.cpp ServerTcpSession.cpp Packet.cpp -lboost_system -lpthread
g++ -std=c++17 -o client Client.cpp TcpSession.cpp ClientTcpSession.cpp Packet.cpp -lboost_system -lpthread
Running the Client and Server
To start the server:

bash
Copy code
./server
To start the client:

bash
Copy code
./client
Both applications will handle TCP communication, with the server listening for incoming connections and the client connecting to the server.
